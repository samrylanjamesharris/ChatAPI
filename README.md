## Security:
- All processing happens **in your browser** â€” no data is sent to any server.
- Your API key is stored **only in localStorage** and never shared.
- Ideal for private, secure AI interactions.

> **Note**: Don't expose your API key on public repositories. This app runs client-side, so your key stays with you.
